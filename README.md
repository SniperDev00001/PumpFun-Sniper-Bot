I employed the standard strategy and also activated the anti-rug option from the menu interface. This serves as an illustrative example showcasing the behavior of the strategy within the dynamic market environment.
Then waits until one of the following pre-established conditions is reached:
<ul>
  <li>Take Profit.</li>
  <li>The maximum trade duration.</li>
  <li>Stop Loss.</li>
</ul>
<br>
By accessing the strategy menu, you have the ability to adjust multiple parameters, allowing you to tailor your own unique strategy and test it directly within the market.

Upon reviewing the operations, it's evident that the bot exhibited **strong performance** overall. The instances where losses occurred were primarily attributed to tokens with minimal fluctuation in value. Notably, **significant losses were absent**, thanks to the activation of the **anti-rug option** prior to running the bot. This feature empowers the bot to thoroughly **analyze tokens**, ensuring they adhere to preset parameters.
